### 2.5.6 Flow-Sensitivity versus Flow-Insensitivity

All of the data flow analyse we have considered so far have been flow-sensitive: this just means that in general we would expect the analysis of a program S1;S2 to differ from the analysis of the program S2;S1 where the statements come in a different order.

Sometimes one considers flow-insensitive analyses where the order of statements is of no importance for the analysis being performed. This may sound weird at first, but suppose that the analysis being performed is like the ones considered in Section 2.1 except that for simplicity all kill components are empty sets. Given these assumptions one might expect that the programs S1;S2 and S2;S1 give rise to the same analysis. Clearly a flow-insensitive analysis may be much less precise than its flow-sensitive analogue but also it is likely to be much cheaper; since interprocedural data flow analyses tend to be very costly, it is there useful to have a repertoire of techniques for reducing the cost.
